Caulfield Common School at the corner of Glenhuntly and Glen Eira Roads was opened in June 1864. In 1877  the school was transferred to a new building on Glenhuntly Road designed by architect Henry Robert Bastow. The extension of rail services through Elsternwick to North Brighton  and from Glenhuntly to Oakleigh and settlement in Caulfield increased the school population. By 1888 attendance grew to 300. In 1888 and 1890-91  extensions were built to cope with this population growth. The 1890-91 addition consisted of a large classroom and an office with a turret. No structural changes have been made since. In 1889 the introduction of the horse tramway in Glenhuntly Road was followed by another increase in school numbers to 450. The opening of electric tram services in Hawthorn and Glenhuntly Roads in 1913 was another spur to increased attendance and 700 children were enrolled. In 1921 a separate two-storey building designed by architect E. Evan Smith was opened  accommodating 1221 children at the school. The 1877 school building is single storey and constructed of polychrome brick. A prominent feature of the building is the turret office and square tower over the entry. The intact interior includes its coved ceilings andglazed partitions added in 1908. The 1921 building is a freestanding two storey building with a three storey section at one end. Constructed of red brick with Marseilles tile roof  the building is simple in style with large multi-pane windows with concrete lintels and prominent chimneys that are corbelled at their base. Contained on the site is a rectangular timber shelter shed with a verandah around all sides.\n\n\n\nHow is it significant?\n\nCaulfield Primary School No.773 is of architectural  social and historical importance to the State of Victoria.\n\n\n\nWhy is it significant?\n\nCaulfield Primary School No.773 is of architectural importance because the 1877 building is a representative example of a school which has developed from one room to a large urban school with little alteration  apart from re-roofing. Its design for the original room in polychrome brick with a jerkin head roof was a prototype for other schools. Of particular interest are the turret over the office and the square tower built in 1890-91. Both are clad in glazed terracotta shingles and the tower has tracery panels under the louvred vents. The 1921 building is a particularly intact example of a school building of that period and is a rare example of the construction of a separate school rather than addition to existing buildings when expansion was required. The timber shelter shed on the site is an unusual example of a rectangular shade structure which demonstrates an essential aspect of school life and a response to climatic conditions. The shed is also unusual as it contains glass windows  indicating that it may have been used as a classroom at some stage.\n\n\n\nCaulfield Primary School No.773 is of social and historical importance as the 1877 building is an example of a school built in response to the 1872 Education Act which gave access to a free  compulsory and secular education. Its expansion reflected the expansion of the suburb of Caulfield  particularly in the boom years of the 1880s and the inter war period of the twentieth century  when the 1921 building was constructed. The buildings are important for their physical manifestation of the changing needs of families and of population changes in the Caulfield area.","address":"724 GLEN HUNTLY ROAD CAULFIELD SOUTH  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":"The first school in Caulfield  supported by the Denominational Board of Education  opened in January 1860.

Robertson commissioned the architect JAB Koch to remodel the house  and Koch may have been responsible for the conservatory as well. Alternatively  the conservatory may have been imported. The gates installed at Labassa in 1890 were manufactured by the MacFarlane foundry of Glasgow  Scotland  a firm known to have manufactured conservatories.\nAround 1917 the glass house from 'Labassa'  Caulfield was offered for sale to Malvern Council for its own gardens but the offer was declined. Following subdivision of the Labassa estate in the 1920s the conservatory was converted into a residence.\nThe structure has a simple rectangular plan  with a brick base and superstructure of cast iron columns and roof trusses. The hipped roof is surmounted by an elaborately decorated gable structure. Most of the original glass has been replaced by metal sheeting. The decoration comprises pressed metal fascias including an egg and dart style cornice moulding  mullion mouldings and gable end panels with a rising sun motif. Cast iron ridgework and finials add to the lively roof form. Internally the floor appears to have been raised as part of the conversion work to a residence  and stained timber panelling introduced to provide room spaces. Boilers probably heated the conservatory in the colder months  but these do not survive.\nHow is it significant?\n\nThe former Labassa Conservatory is of historical and architectural significance to the State of Victoria.\nWhy is it significant?\n\nThe former Labassa Conservatory is historically significant for its associations with the Labassa estate. Subdivision of the estate separated a number of outbuildings from the mansion. The former conservatory is significant as part of the large scale improvements carried out to the estate in the 1890s. The nineteenth century was the great age of conservatory designs  enabled by technological developments in heating  glazing and iron. Whilst conservatories were common in botanical gardens and universities  where they were primarily used for cultivating  studying  and experimenting with plants  they had also become an accessory of the wealthy on private estates.\nThe former Labassa conservatory is architecturally significant as a rare example of a building type. Many Victorian mansion houses had attached conservatories  but detached conservatories were much less common. The only other detached example associated with a residence known to survive on its original site in Victoria is an earlier example at Warrock homestead  near Casterton. Conservatories attached to nineteenth century mansions are far more numerous. The Labassa example is very ornate  and its decoration draws on the versatility of pressed metal and cast iron. Thishighlights the dual purpose of the conservatory  as both a functional structure and a picturesque building on the Labassa estate. This building is unusual as an example converted to residential use.\n\n","address":"21 MANOR GROVE CAULFIELD  Glen Eira City","summary":"The former Labassa Conservatory is believed to have been built as part of the extensive reworking of the Labassa estate in c1890 for the new owner Alexander Robertson  proprietor of the Cobb","postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"4~~~~"},{"hist_id":3,"latitude":-37.88434,"longitude":145.01671,"name":"FORMER RED CROSS REST HOUSE","image_url":"http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/208\/636.jpg","description":"What is significant?\nThe Former Red Cross Rest House (Building 15)  and the immediate surrounds of the building including the lawn area and trees to the front of the Former Red Cross Rest House.\n- History Summary\nDuring World War I (1914-18) over 60 000 members of the First AIF (Australian Imperial Force) were killed and a further 170 000 were treated for physical or mental wounds. In mid-1915 the first wounded soldiers returned to Australia from Gallipoli and the government subsequently established a network of repatriation hospitals and convalescent facilities. Prior to the formal establishment of the Commonwealth Department of Repatriation in 1917  the Department of Defence was responsible for the establishment of large-scale medical and rehabilitation facilities. In Victoria there were three Australian General Hospitals (AGHs): AGH 5 (St Kilda Road)  AGH 16 (Mont Park)  and AGH 11 (Caulfield). AGH 11 was the largest of the three Victorian hospitals and the third largest AGH in Australia. Initially located in the Glen Eira Mansion (now demolished)  it officially opened on 17 April 1916 and additional buildings were constructed within the grounds during the war to meet growing demand. The Australian Red Cross  established in August 1914 as a branch of the British Red Cross Society  also played a vital role in the repatriation of returned soldiers through its mobilisation of thousands of homefront women and the establishment of convalescent facilities. A Red Cross 'Rest Home' opened at the Caulfield Hospital in August 1916. It provided a cheery home like environment for patients  particularly those who had travelled from across the state  to recuperate in the care of Red Cross Voluntary Aid Detachment workers.\nBy 1919  the number of repatriation patients treated at the Caulfield Hospital was over 1 000 each day. The Caulfield Hospital remained Victoria's main 'Repat' hospital for many decades providing medical and rehabilitation services to veterans from across the state. A newly constructed nurses' wing  known as Caulfield House  opened in 1936 and it was expanded in 1937. In 1965 the original Glen Eira mansion was demolished and the Victorian Government acquired the last of the Caulfield Hospital assets from the Repatriation Department. The Southern Memorial Hospital (which was used primarily for civilian patients) opened on the site in 1968. In 1979 the Red Cross Rest House was remodelled and transferred to the Victorian State Government. It was renovated in 2001 and reopened as the Montgomery Nursing Home. Today  the Caulfield Hospital has a statewide role in the provision of rehabilitation services and continues to maintain a strong link with the veteran community.\nDescription Summary\nThe subject site is part of the traditional land of the Bun Wurrung people.\nThe current Caulfield Hospital extends across several acres  and is located on Crown Land that is leased to health care providers. The historically significant part of the Caulfield Hospital comprises the Former Red Cross Rest House and its surrounds in the southern part of the site.\nThe building of significance is:\n- Former Red Cross Rest House (Building 15): a single storey rendered brick bungalow-style building designed by former Public Works Department Architect A J MacDonald. Constructed in 1916 the building features wide verandahs  sash windows and a projecting gable to the west that extends beyond the verandah and once formed the main entry. Despite changes made in 1979 and 2001 the building retains much of its original form and many of its original materials.\nHow is it significant?\nThe Former Red Cross Rest House is of historical significance to the State of Victoria. It satisfies the following criterion for inclusion in the Victorian Heritage Register:\nCriterion A\nImportance to the course  or pattern  of Victoria's cultural history\nCriterion B\nPossession of uncommon  rare or endangered aspects of Victoria's cultural history\nCriterion H\nSpecial association with the life or works of a person  or group of persons  of importance in Victoria's history\nWhy is it significant?\nThe Former Red Cross Rest House is historically significant as an intact remnant of Victoria's primary World War I (1914-18) Repatriation Hospitals. Officially opened as the Australian General Hospital No.11 (AGH No.11) in April 1916  the Former Caulfield Repatriation Hospital was initially located in the Glen Eira Mansion (now demolished) and additional buildings were constructed within the grounds during the war to meet growing demand. Between 1917 and 1919  the hospital accommodated an estimated 19 800 admissions  and between 1916 and 1919 the complex of buildings at the Caulfield Hospital provided rest and recreation for approximately 30 000 men. The Former Red Cross Rest House  a surviving element of the Former Caulfield Repatriation Hospital  demonstrates the profound and ongoing impact of World War I on returned service people  their families and the wider Victorian community  and the involvement of that community in the establishment of repatriation facilities for returned service people during and after World War 1.. (Criterion A)\nThe Former Red Cross Rest House is uncommon as a purpose-built World War I Red Cross Rest House in Victoria and remains as tangible evidence of the Red Cross's comprehensive program of establishing Rest Homes and Rest Rooms to provide repatriation and convalescent services to support soldiers during and after World War I (Criterion B).\nThe Former Red Cross Rest House is historically significant for its association with the Australian Red Cross. The Red Cross is one of Australia's largest and oldest non-government voluntary organisations. Established in August 1914  the Red Cross attracted hundreds of thousands of patriotic volunteers  predominantly women  who mobilised to support service personnel overseas and returning to the homefront during and after World War I. Shortly after the opening of Caulfield Hospital  the Red Cross established the Red Cross Rest House  which provided a cheery home-like environment for patients  particularly those who had travelled from across the state  to convalesce in the care of Red Cross Voluntary Aid Detachment workers. Having establishing the Former Red Cross Rest House in 1916 to provide repatriation services and care to returned service people during and after World War 1  the Red Cross was directly associated with the Former Red Cross Rest House for approximately 60 years.

The pipe organ at St Aloysius' Church is a very rare example of an organ built in South Australia by a German immigrant who became the most prolific local organbuilder in that state during the later 19th century. Johann Wilhelm Wolff built organs for many churches in Adelaide  but sadly only two of his larger instruments remain unaltered  this being one of them.\n\nHow is it significant? The organ is significant for historic  aesthetic and technical reasons at a state level.\n\nWhy is it significant? The pipe organ at St Aloysius' Church  Caulfield is significant for the following reasons:\n\n. It is one of two surviving examples of a two-manual organ built by J.W. Wolff to remain unaltered\n\n. Wolff was among the leading organbuilders in South Australia during the second half of the 19th century\n\n. The instrument remains in a substantially intact state\n\n. The overall sound is highly pleasing  in a fine acoustic  with sounds that differ from the normal English-inspired traditions that were prevalent in Australia\n\n. The placement of the Great drawstops in a single column on the left side of the console and the Swell drawstops on the right\n\n. The presence of the unique Suavial (harkening back to its builder's Germanic background - a type of Lieblich Gedackt) and the Salicet (a narrow scale string rank)\n\n. The inclusion of seven ranks of splendidly made wooden pipework  mainly with inverted upper lips - a reflection of the difficulty of obtaining metal organ pipes in Adelaide at the time and in accord with German traditions\n\n. The casework  which has three flats of (originally) gilt dummy wooden pipes placed within three flats with carved ogee Gothic canopies\n\n. The layout of the windchests is locally unique  with the Great divided on C and C# chests on either side of the centrally placed tenor C Swell\n\nClassified: 'State' 30\/05\/2011\n","address":"233 Balaclava Road  CAULFIELD  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":"Church Statement of Significance.

From 1876 to 1984 Glenfern had only two owners  including the well known Melbourne family of artists  the Boyds. The property was bequeathed to the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) in 1984 and has remained in their ownership.\nThe original Glenfern allotment was bought by John Bakewell in 1856 and sold the following year to Francis McDonnell  a prominent Melbourne investor. By 1858  the house  rated as the most valuable in Caulfield  had been built on the site. Due to financial difficulties  McDonnell offered a number of properties for sale in 1860  including Glenfern. It was not sold at this stage  but subsequently mortgaged in 1862. In 1866 Thomas Watson purchased the property and lived there until 1876 when it was sold to Captain John T. T. Boyd and his wife  Lucy  founders of the Boyd dynasty of artists  musicians  writers and architects. The Boyd family  including twelve children  lived there until 1907  with Lucy Boyd retaining ownership after her husband's death in 1891.\nIn 1907 the property was subdivided and the greatly reduced Glenfern portion was purchased by the Ostberg family  who lived there from 1915. In the latter years of Boyd family ownership and the Ostberg ownership  Glenfern had several tenants and was run as a school on two occasions. The Ostberg family occupancy continued until the death of Miss Amy Ostberg in 1984. From 1929 the property was listed as Glenfern Flats  necessitating various internal alterations over a period of time.\nThe original two storey house  attributed to architect Charles Laing  was extended for the Boyd family in 1876  by architect M. Hennessy. This comprised the addition of a two storey wing to the south of the existing building. Stables were built in 1884 by the architects Smith and Johnson and other outbuildings  since removed  were recorded on the site. The gardens were developed from the establishment of the estate and remnants of early plantings  exotic trees in particular  are evident. Various additions and alterations were made to the house in the twentieth century and a separate block of flats was built on the southern boundary in c1964.\nGlenfern is a two storey picturesque Gothic house of stuccoed brick with steep  gabled slate roofs  elaborate bargeboards and chimneys of conjoined stacks set diagonally. The original  asymmetrically planned L-shaped house  containing the principal rooms and a rear wing  was designed with two main facades facing north and west. The north facade contains an unusual recessed pointed arch bay formed between twin chimney flues. Internally cedar joinery includes an unusual set of double doors between the drawing room and parlour  the centre pair of which fold back and then slide into the walls.\nDetailing of the 1876 additions copied that of the original house  including the bargeboards  chimneys and western verandah.\nOwnership of Glenfern passed to the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) in 1984 and in 2002 transformation of the property into a Centre for the Arts and Culture commenced. This began with the establishment of an Artist-in-residence programme  followed by the Glenfern Writers Centre. Restoration and renovation of the building has been undertaken concurrently with the establishment of this centre.\nHow is it significant?\nGlenfern  East St Kilda is of architectural and historical significance to the State of Victoria.\nWhy is it significant?\n\nGlenfern is of architectural significance as an unusually intact and rare example of the picturesque domestic Gothic Revival house in Victoria. Of particular note are the clustered chimneys  bargeboards and twin arched chimney flues and the folding\/sliding cedar doors between the principal rooms. It is significant as an important work of the prominent Melbourne architect  Charles Laing.\nGlenfern is of historical significance for its connection with the distinguished Victorian Boyd family. It has been recorded in a painting by Emma Boyd  wife of Arthur  in 1885 and in print by writer  Martin Boyd in 1952.\nGlenfern is of historical significance due to its ownership by only two families from 1876; firstly the Boyds until 1907 and the Ostbergs until 1984. Of note is the resistance to redevelopment in the latter half of the twentieth century and the subsequent survival of the 1907 Glenfern estate.\n[Online Data Upgrade Project 2007]\n","address":"417 Inkerman Street  ST KILDA EAST  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":"Glenfern was built on spacious grounds at the corner of Inkerman and Hotham Streets  East St Kilda in two main stages in 1857 and 1876.

The builder was Herbert H. Coulson. The office  complete with postmaster's quarters  was a substantial two storey red brick building set on a bluestone plinth with an ornate facade incorporating cement dressings. The Elsternwick Post Office complex originally included a public lobby mail  lobby  telegraph and sorting offices  hall  dining hall  kitchen and stores  all on the ground floor. The first floor consisted of two bedrooms  sitting room  servants' room  bathroom and landing.\nSince 1891 it has presented an imposing facade to Glenhuntly road and Riddell parade  on the corner of which it stands. Immediately adjacent on the other side  but also facing Glenhuntly Road  is a small single storey structure  the Rifle Club building. The two buildings are surrounded on the two remaining sides by an open space reserve. The Elsternwick Post Office is an early  and substantially intact  example of the English \"Queen Anne\" style which was introduced to Australia c.1885  and first seen in a fully developed form in Victoria in the Queenscliff Post Office of that year. Together with the Queenscliff Post Office  Kew Post Office  Courthouse and Police Station  and selected schools such as that at High Street  Prahran  the Post Office represents a notable stylistic innovation in Victoria architecture on the part of the Public Works Department.\nThe style imported from England was characterised by a predominance of red brick  with dressings of stone or stucco  and by steep proportions with dominant roofs incorporating hipped and gabled forms as well as dormers  tall chimneys and  occasionally  towers. Most of the details as well as the often picturesque roofscapes were derived from the Renaissance architecture of northern Europe and  in particular  England. Other common features of English \"Queen Anne\" designs include the use of coved cornices at eaves level  the articulation of the facade by means of pilasters  and the preference for tall narrow multi-paned windows with white painted sashes  and carved brick aprons under the sills. The Australian style of \"Queen Anne\" developed out of the English. For many years it was referred to as \"Queen Anne\"  but some examples (especially of domestic architecture) are now known as \"Federation Style\".\n\"Queen Anne\" also has its American variants. The term English \"Queen Anne\" may be used to distinguish it from later Australian and American versions. The inverted commas indicate that this is not the real architecture of Queen Anne\u0101\u20ac\u2122s reign.\nExamples of the buildings influenced by English \"Queen Anne\" style began to appear in a period of considerable building activity in the late 1880s. Whereas many of the comparable commercial examples of this style have been destroyed  mutilated or painted over some Public Works Department designs have survived  and  with the regrettable exception of Queenscliff  have maintained their red brick character. The Post Office at Elsternwick is significant in this  not only in its own right  and as part of a group of important buildings  but also as a visible representation of the Queenscliff design in a relatively unspoiled form. At Elsternwick the design has been maintained overall and  where extended  this has been done sympathetically (an exception to this is the post office boxes facing Riddell parade). In developing this  and other distinctive new designs  the architects of the Public Works Department in the late 1880s and 1890s were breaking new ground  not only in Victoria but also on a national basis. This was all the more remarkable when it is considered that government departments were not previously known for their commitment to  and encouragement of  innovation.\nThe building may also be regarded as important to the Elsternwick community  and expressive of the history of the district. Settlement in the area followed two land surveys  one by Robert Hoddle in 1851 and the other by Henry Foot in 1856. A prominent early settler was Charles Hodson Ebden  a pastoralist who in 1851 became Auditor-General of Victoria. He named his property \"Elster\"  which is German for magpie  and \"wick\" (meaning village) was added in later years. The coming of the railway in 1859  which passed through Elsternwick en route to Brighton  made for a settlement around the station  and this encouraged the introduction of postal services. However  development of Elsternwick was blocked by several surrounding large properties  and it was not until the boom decade of the 1880s that it really\n\nbegan to go ahead as a commercial and residential centre. From the mid 1880s the new community agitated for secession from Caulfield shire  and for a new post office building more in keeping with the aspiration of a developing suburban district. This agitation was successful. In 1890 land was exchanged with the railway department  with a view to building an office on a suitable site  and tenders were called for in August.\nThe importance of the new building can be seen in its location adjacent to what was then the focal point of the district  the railway station. With the new building also came an extended postal district for Elsternwick  taking in additional portions of St Kilda and Caulfield. The new building also comprised residential quarters and a new postmistress  Mary Kate Oldham  was appointed in the same year the office was built.\n","address":"296 - 298 GLENHUNTLY ROAD and 1A AND 1B RIDDELL PARADE ELSTERNWICK  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":"The Elsternwick Post Office was built in 1891 to the design of the Public Works Department under JH Marsden.

He was born in England in 1834 and arrived in Melbourne in 1850. He soon joined his father's wholesale soft goods firm  spending some time as its manager on the goldfields. Sargood entered the Legislative Council in 1874. He was Victoria?s first Minister for Defence in 1883. Sir Frederick Sargood was created CMG. In 1885 and KCMG in 1890 as a reward for his contribution to public life. He died suddenly in 1903.\nRippon Lea was designed by the leading firm of architects  Reed and Barnes. Joseph Reed had travelled in Europe in 1863  including northern Italy. When he returned he introduced the use of polychromy. While not the first examples  Rippon Lea and the Independent Church in Collins Street were the best and set a fashion which became a distinctly Melbourne style  particularly used for houses and churches. Its popularity was possible because of the new availability of different coloured bricks. Reed's fine Lombardic Romanesque details soon became debased by others.\nAs Sargood's family grew and his fortunes prospered  Rippon Lea was extended to include 33 rooms - a complete mansion. The cast iron porte cochere and the northern conservatory were added in 1897. The architects were Taylor and Fitts. The ballroom was added in 1882 and remodelled in 1889. Many alterations have changed the interior and exterior during the ownerships of Benjamin Nathan and later his daughter Mrs Louisa Jones in the 1930s and are in their own right of significance.\nSir Thomas Bent owned the property from 1903 until 1911 but never lived there.

The lake  waterfalls  fernery  hill and grotto are balanced by mighty deciduous trees and conifers. These are interspersed with  but never dominated by Australian species such as eucalyptus and other exotics. The sinuous drive with its carefully prepared approach to the house is notable. The original vegetable gardens  orchard and outer paddocks no longer survive. The shade house is important as the largest known in Australia and possibly the world. Its curved plan and form of construction are particularly notable. It was built about 1884.\n","address":"192 Hotham Street ELSTERNWICK  Glen Eira City","summary":"Rippon Lea was commenced in 1868 by Frederick Sargood  a most successful politician and merchant.

It was one of 32 new fire stations built between 1892 and 1896 by the newly formed Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade ('MFB') to form a comprehensive fire-fighting network across Melbourne. The MFB was established in 1891 as Victoria's government-run fire-fighting service in Melbourne and its growing suburbs. By 1918 motorised fire engine appliances had replaced horse-drawn fire vehicles across the metropolitan area  and the consequently larger areas that fire stations could protect meant the 1896 Elsternwick Fire Station was one of many which was becoming obsolete. The MFB continued to use the Elsternwick Fire Station up until the Station's closure in 1926. From 1927 the former Fire Station was leased by neighbouring timber merchants JJ Webster Pty Ltd who subsequently purchased the property from the MFB in 1934. From 1954 the 'Esquire Motors' car repair business traded at the site  and changes to the former Fire Station building including the complete enclosure of its yard by corrugated steel walls and roofing appear to have been completed in the mid-1950s. In 1990 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ('ABC') purchased the former Fire Station together with five other adjoining land parcels in Selwyn Street. From that time until 2017 the former Elsternwick Fire Station has been used by the ABC as office and storage space in its Selwyn Street television studio complex.\nDescription Summary\nThe Former Elsternwick Fire Station consists of an 1896 building on Selwyn Street and adjoining 1950s-built additions under a group of skillion and flat roofs to the 1896 building's east\/rear. The single-storey 1896 building has walls of brick and stone construction with an asymmetrical principal facade built to the Selwyn Street (west) site boundary. A stone-framed horseshoe arch entrance to the former Station's fire engine room is the dominant feature of this facade. The arch features a carefully-detailed composition of rusticated and smooth-faced limestone  trachyte and fine axed basalt  and frames the engine room's original bi-fold timber doors. This portion of the Selwyn Street facade is surmounted by an Anglo-Dutch gable with a central large heraldic emblem which contains what appears to be the 1891 MFB-designed corporate shield. Most of the original eastern masonry wall of the fire engine room has been removed to create a larger garage area  most probably in the mid-1950s. Several courses of this wall's original brickwork remain above a steel lintel. The garage area's floor is a concrete slab and is also likely to have been installed in the mid-1950s. The south elevation of the Former Elsternwick Fire Station is built to the site boundary along an un-named lane. Conventional timber-framed pitched and hipped roofs above the original former Station building appear to have retained their original form  but the original roofing slates have been replaced by corrugated steel sheeting. A corrugated galvanised steel-clad external wall and skillion and flat roofs  which are likely to date from the mid-1950s  completely enclose the east\/rear portion of the site. The area beneath these roofs is divided by timber-framed partition walls into four separate storage areas and a small lavatory\/washroom area. Apart from ceramic tiles in these lavatories  the floors of the 1950s-built spaces are concrete floor slabs. The north and east boundaries of the Former Elsternwick Fire Station site abut the corrugated-steel sheeting clad walls of a large building containing production and storage areas in the ABC's Selwyn Street television studio complex.\nThis site is part of the traditional land of the Boonwurrung people.\nHow is it significant?\nThe former Elsternwick Fire Station is of architectural  cultural and historical significance to the State of Victoria. It satisfies the following criterion for inclusion in the Victorian Heritage Register:\nCriterion A\nImportance to the course  or pattern  of Victoria's cultural history.\nCriterion D\nImportance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural places and objects.\nWhy is it significant?\nThe Former Elsternwick Fire Station is significant at the State level for the following reasons:\nThe Former Elsternwick Fire Station is historically significant as one of the 10 remaining fire stations of the original 32 built for the newly established Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade ('MFB') during the four-year period 1892 to 1896. These fire stations were constructed following the establishment in 1891 of the MFB  Victoria's government-run fire-fighting service for metropolitan Melbourne and its growing suburban population. These new stations formed a crucial part of the MFB's fire-fighting network across Melbourne. The Former Elsternwick Fire Station clearly demonstrates the historical development of fire-fighting services in Melbourne  especially the expansion of the newly-formed MFB throughout Melbourne's suburbs during the 1890s. [Criterion A]\nThe Former Elsternwick Fire Station is architecturally significant as a fine example of a late nineteenth century fire station. Constructed shortly after the establishment of the MFB  it displays characteristics of its class of place that remain mostly unchanged from the former Station's historically important period of development and use. A particularly strong element of the Former Elsternwick Fire Station is the large and strikingly-detailed stone horseshoe arch  designed for horse-drawn fire-fighting vehicles  at the street entrance to its fire-engine room.

The municipalities of Prahran and Malvern cooperated to establish the Prahran and Malvern Tramway Trust (P&MTT) in 1907  and in 1910 opened its first line  along High Street from Charles Street in Prahran to Tooranga Road  Malvern. A car depot (VHR H910) with an attached substation to power the system was built in Coldblo Road  Malvern (now Armadale). A number of adjoining municipalities were to join the scheme during the following decade  and many new lines and extensions to existing lines were constructed by the Trust  including services along High Street  Dandenong Road  Wattletree Road  Balaclava Road  Cotham Road  High Street and Barkers Road in Kew  Glenhuntly Road  Waverley Road  St Kilda Road  Glenferrie Road  Malvern Road  Whitehorse Road and Burke Road. This became the largest independent electric tram network in Melbourne  consisting of almost all of the tram system which exists in the area today. Electricity to power the trams was at first provided solely from the substation at the Coldblo Road depot  but in 1914 a new substation was built at Elsternwick and was switched into the system in December that year to provide extra power. The building was probably designed by the architect Leonard John Flannagan  who had been chief architect for the Trust since 1908. The substation was equipped with a battery  an automatic reversible booster and two 100kw generators relocated from Coldblo Road. In 1919 the P&MTT was taken over by the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board  which continued to operate the substation until the late 1960s.\nDescription Summary\nThe Former Elsternwick Tram Substation is a red brick and stucco building in a Federation Free Classical style. It has two parallel glazed roof lanterns  timber-framed windows and the walls are topped with alternating curved and horizontal parapets with piers projecting above. The letters 'P&MTT' in cast cement distinguish the central parapet. The original large off-centre opening for the movement of electrical plant has been filled in. The building has been converted for use as an office but internally the steel trusses remain as do overhead pulleys for the movement of electrical plant within the building. A small modern brick addition has been made at the rear of the building.\nThis site is part of the traditional land of the Kulin Nation.\n<b class=\"c3\">How is it significant? \nThe Former Elsternwick Tram Substation is of historical and architectural significance to the State of Victoria and satisfies the following criteria for inclusion in the Victorian Heritage Register:\nCriterion A Importance to the course  or pattern  of Victoria's cultural history\nCriterion D Importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural places and objects\nWhy is it significant?\nThe Former Elsternwick Tram Substation is significant to the State of Victoria for the following reasons:\nThe Former Elsternwick Tram Substation is historically significant for its association with the Prahran and Malvern Tramways Trust (P&MTT)  one of the first  and the most important  of Melbourne's municipal tramway trusts  which preceded the Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board. The tramway trusts established by various private companies and suburban municipalities in the first decades of the twentieth century provided Melbourne's first regular electric tram services  and in the early twentieth century were important for their influence on the development of new suburbs not served by the existing railway lines. The P&MTT was the largest of the municipal tramway trusts and the lines constructed by it formed the basis of the present extensive tram system in the south-east suburbs of Melbourne. (Criterion A)\nThe Former Elsternwick Tram Substation is architecturally significant as the earliest example in Victoria of a free-standing tram substation  and demonstrates the form and scale of the buildings constructed to house the electrical equipment to operate the early electric tram lines. It is a demonstration of the importance attached to the architecture of utilitarian industrial buildings at the time.

It is historically and aesthetically significant. It is historically significant (Criterion A) as a very early subdivision demonstrating the planning principals of the Garden Suburb Movement in the highly sophisticated manner of the late 1920s. These principals include the treatment of the street and residential front gardens as a single garden landscape exemplified by the use of low front and side fences  coupled crossing  uniform street tree plantings  45 degree corner spalys at the entry to the court and a curved wall closing the vista at the far end. The historical importance of the subdivision rests also on the fact that the houses built by the Whites and which constitute the principal elements of the place post date the earliest comparable subdivision undertaken by the better known estate developers Dickson and Yorkston Pty. Ltd. in St Kilda East by only a year. Bruce Court compares chronologically also with Linden Court  Windsor (1928) and Crompton Court  Caulfield South (1929) whilsts others of similar urban character were to follow. The survival of \"Miranda\" is of historic interest as the house that preceded the development of the court but survives as evidence of this earlier time. The blocks on which the houses of the early \"thirties facing Parkside Street are located formed part of the original estate and are of historic interest in this respect. No. 34 is of importance also as it marks the entry to the court  together with No. 48.\nThe subdivision is of aesthetic importance (Criterion E) not only for its Garden Suburb character but also for the manner in which the Whites' houses  though stylistically diverse in the manner of the period  use a common architectural vocabulary the imparts aesthetic unity to the court. In this respect the place epitomizes the qualities that distinguish the Garden Suburb Movement in metropolitan Melbourne during the late 1920s.\n","address":"Bruce Court ELSTERNWICK  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":"The Bruce Court estate of William White and Sons of Parkside Street  Elsternwick  was formed in 1927 and developed by them in 1928-29 with nos. 32-34 Parkside Street being undertaken by\u00c9","postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"8~~~~"},{"hist_id":136,"latitude":-37.87823,"longitude":145.0073,"name":"Caulfield Anglican Church (Stained Glass Window) (First World War)","image_url":"http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/191\/439.jpg","description":null,"address":"281 Glen Eira Road ELSTERNWICK  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":null,"postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"8~~~~"},{"hist_id":137,"latitude":-37.885272,"longitude":145.012136,"name":"Elsternwick Methodist Church Honour Roll (First World War)","image_url":"http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/191\/545.jpg","description":"The Honour Roll was unveiled by the Reverend Dr. Fitchett on the 26th June 1916 and commemorates those connected with the church who served in World War One.","address":"567 Glenhuntly Road ELSTERNWICK  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":null,"postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"8~~~~"},{"hist_id":138,"latitude":-37.88567,"longitude":145.01193,"name":"Yarraville Methodist Church Honour Roll (Second World War)","image_url":"http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/191\/546.jpg","description":"Yarraville Methodist Church Honour Roll honours those who served in World War Two.","address":"567 Glenhuntly Road ELSTERNWICK  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":null,"postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"8~~~~"},{"hist_id":139,"latitude":-37.88482,"longitude":145.00478,"name":"Footscray Methodist Church Honour Roll (First World War)","image_url":"http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/191\/547.jpg","description":null,"address":"Elsternwick Uniting Church  ELSTERNWICK  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":null,"postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"8~~~~"},{"hist_id":140,"latitude":-37.88462,"longitude":145.00209,"name":"St Kilda Methodist Church Honour Roll (First World War)","image_url":"http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/191\/563.jpg","description":null,"address":"302 Glenhuntly Road ELSTERNWICK  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":null,"postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"8~~~~"},{"hist_id":141,"latitude":-37.88421,"longitude":145.005972,"name":"Stained Glass Window at Elsternwick Orrong Road Methodist Church","image_url":"http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/198\/407.jpg  http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/198\/409.jpg  http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/198\/411.jpg","description":null,"address":"Orrong Road  Elsternwick  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":null,"postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"8~~~~"},{"hist_id":142,"latitude":-37.885282,"longitude":145.008667,"name":"Stained Glass Window at Elsternwick St. Clement's Anglican Church","image_url":null,"description":null,"address":"201 Glenhuntly Road  Elsternwick  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":null,"postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"8~~~~"},{"hist_id":143,"latitude":-37.88355,"longitude":145.00348,"name":"Stained Glass Windows Caulfield RSL  Elsternwick","image_url":"http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/200\/290.jpg","description":null,"address":"8 St. George's Road Elsternwick  GLEN EIRA CITY","summary":null,"postal_code_ps_val~~~~":"8~~~~"},{"hist_id":144,"latitude":-37.917154,"longitude":145.03878,"name":"9 Vickery Street","image_url":"http:\/\/vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au\/vhd-images\/places\/000\/029\/423.jpg","description":"The late Victorian villa at no. 9 Vickerey Street is important in Bentleigh as an early surviving house demonstrating the commencement of its settlement late last century.
